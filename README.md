XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a vulnerability which occurs due to the injection of malicious scripts into trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code,generally in the form of a browser side script, to different end user. Mostly XSS vulnerabilities require some type of interaction by the user to trigger the vulnerability, either via social engineering, or waiting for someone to visit a specific page. Because of this reason developers often do not take it seriously, but if left unpatched, its very dangerous.
Google is so serious about finding and fixing XSS issues that they are paying mercenaries up to $7,500 for dangerous XSS bugs discovered in our most sensitive products. 
XSS game is a training program in which one will learn to find and exploit XSS bugs. We can use this knowledge to confuse and infuriate our adversaries by preventing such bugs from happening in our applications.
